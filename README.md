HTML and CSS Structure
This implementation features a clean and minimal interface:
Canvas Element: The central element where the Game of Life grid is displayed

Control Buttons:
Start/Stop: Toggles simulation running state
Clear: Resets the grid to empty
Random: Populates the grid with random live cells
Pattern Buttons: Places predefined patterns (Glider Gun, Pulsar, PentaDecathlon)

CSS Styling:

Centers content using CSS Grid
Provides clean button styling
Sets up a bordered canvas with light gray background

Game Class

This class encapsulates all the game mechanics and state:
Core Properties and Initialization

rows, cols: Defines grid dimensions
cellSize: Determines the pixel size of each cell
grid: 2D array representing cell states (true = alive, false = dead)
isRunning: Boolean flag to track animation state

Grid Management

createEmptyGrid(): Creates a 2D array filled with false values (empty grid)
randomize(): Populates the grid randomly with ~15% live cells

Pattern Generators

drawGliderGun(): Places a Gosper Glider Gun pattern

This pattern continuously generates "gliders" (moving patterns)
Uses coordinates stored in a "metrix" array


drawPulsar(): Places a Pulsar pattern

A period-3 oscillator (repeats every 3 generations)
Symmetrical pattern that resembles a pulsating entity


drawPentaDecathlon(): Places a PentaDecathlon pattern

A period-15 oscillator (repeats every 15 generations)
10-cell pattern that undergoes complex transformations



Game Logic

countNeighbors(x, y): Calculates live neighbors for any cell

Checks all 8 surrounding positions
Uses modulo arithmetic to create a wrapping effect at grid edges
Enables "toroidal" universe where patterns can wrap around edges


update(): Core algorithm implementing Conway's Game of Life rules

Creates a new grid rather than modifying the existing one
Applies the following rules:

Live cells with 2-3 neighbors survive
Dead cells with exactly 3 neighbors become alive
All other cells die or stay dead

Renderer Class
This class handles the visualization:

Constructor: Sets up the canvas context and dimensions
draw(): Visualizes the current grid state

Clears previous frame
Draws filled rectangles for live cells using dark blue color
Leaves small gaps between cells for better visibility


Event Handling and Initialization
The initialization sets up:

Game Creation:

Creates a 180Ã—360 cell grid with 5px cells
Results in a large canvas suitable for complex patterns


Animation Management:

Uses setInterval/clearInterval for animation
Updates at 1ms intervals (extremely fast)
Toggleable via Start/Stop button


Button Event Handlers:

Each button connects to its respective function
Includes immediate redrawing after state changes

Important Bug Fix
The initial code contained an error in the event handler for the PentaDecathlon button. It was incorrectly calling the drawGosperGliderGun function instead of drawPentaDecathlon.
This was fixed in the final version by calling the correct drawPentaDecathlon function when the PentaDecathlon button is clicked.
This error would have caused the PentaDecathlon button to actually place a Glider Gun on the grid instead of the intended PentaDecathlon pattern, making the button behave incorrectly and essentially duplicating the Glider Gun button's functionality.
